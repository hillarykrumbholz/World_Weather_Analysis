# World Weather Analysis

### Project Overview
Analyze, create visuals, and statistically graph the weather data for a potential travel company. Their app PlanMyTrip will use the data to recommend ideal hotels based on clients’ weather preferences. 

### Resources
- Data source: API from OpenWeatherMap, API from GoogleMaps
- Software: Python 3.6.9, Jupyter Notebook, Pandas Library, MatPLotLib, SciPy Libraries

### Objectives
- Provide real-time suggestions for our client’s ideal hotels
- Create a Pandas DataFrame with 500 or more of the world’s unique cities and their weather data in real time. This process will entail collecting, analyzing, and visualizing the data.

## Challenge

### Part 1: Get Weather Description and Amount of Precipitation for Each City
How many cities have recorded rainfall or snow at the time the API was pulled?
- 64 cites have experienced rainfall in the last 3 hours.
- 30 cities have experienced snowfall in the last 3 hours.

### Part 2: Have Customers Narrow Their Travel Searches Based on Temperature and Precipitation
The client chose a location with a minimum temperature of 65 F and maximum temperature of 90 F, and where it has not been raining or snowing in the last 3 hours. 

A map marking the location that meet the clients preferred criteria:
